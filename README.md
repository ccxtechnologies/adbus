# async-dbus-python
DBUS Library for Python using Async

# This project is currently under development

- Currently developing it using the systemd dbus library, you will need 
libsystemd to use it. I'm using version 232, but older versions may work. NOTE: You don't have to use systemd to have libsystemd on your system.

- Since this is using coroutines, I'm using Python 3.6. I also like the new format
strings. This module will probaly never work on a version of python older than 3.6.
